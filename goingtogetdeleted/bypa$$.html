	<small><i>What does that mean? I didn't spend a lot of time with the make up of the page. I did spend a lot of time with the whole Bypa$$ thing though.</i></small><br><br>
	<tt>Because of distanced learning, some of you, who do not have acces to another computer besides a chromebook, are plagued with being required to use a chrome extension such as GoGuardian or Secur.ly. Sometimes they block what shouldn't be blocked. <b>THIS IS ONLY NECESSARY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE INSPECT ELEMENT <u>DISABLED</u>!</b> I have decided to share my javascript bypa$$ because not everyone can use my <a href="javascript:alert('I will insert this later.');">Chrome JS version because they don't have inspect element disabled.</a>. Drag the link below into your bookmarks bar, and click it whenever you need it. THIS IS NOT COMPLETED!</tt>
