	<pre>
If you are reading this you are probably desperate to have FireRTC back and most likely don't have an account. I would like to create a team of people to create a new FireRTC that is similar meaning that:
1. You can choose your caller id
2. You can call anyone in the US
3. The website looks cool
4. It is FREE

NOT meaning that:
1. It keeps crashing
2. Users are randomly blocked
3. You can't make an account

By the way, someone on this page, 'community.firertc.com', posted something similar and that was BobRTC. I don't mean to be a Debbie Downer, but it isn't good if you can't pick your caller id and change it whenever you'd like.

Lastly, if you are a developer go ahead and contact me. I will answer and put you on the team. This will be built on github.
